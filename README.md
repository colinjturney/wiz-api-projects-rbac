# Description

The aim of this script is to automate the creation of a project structure within Wiz based upon a Management Group/Organizational Unit structure held within Wiz's security graph- i.e. from a Cloud environment that is already connected to Wiz.

It also aims to build an RBAC structure based upon the user accounts that have role bindings mapped to each subscription.

## Limitations to current functionality

The script currently operates in a read-only mode. The code has NOT yet been written to perform mutations on the Wiz API to actually create projects or provision users. Instead it will just generate two CSV files as follows:
* mock_project_output.csv: Details the projects it would create within Wiz.
* mock_user_output.csv: Detailing the users/roles that would be provisioned.

The idea behind generating these CSV files is so that it can be verified that the intended project structures and RBAC mappings are correct before being implemented for real.

## Output Files

* mock_project_output.csv: Details the projects that would be created within Wiz, with the following fields:
    * Project Name (string): The name of the project being created.
    * Project Path (string): The path to this project, through folder projects that contain it.
    * Is Folder (bool): Details whether this would be created as a folder project.
    * Project ID (string): A mocked identifier to this project. Intended as a placeholder to the identifier generated by Wiz when the project is created through the call to the Wiz API
    * Parent Project ID (string): Reference to the parent folder project ID that this project would be created within.

* mock_user_output.csv: Details the users/roles that would be provisioned.
    * Display Name: A human-friendly display name for the given user
    * Email Address: The user's email address
    * Role: The Wiz RBAC role mapped to this user
    * Project Path: The path to the project this role is being scoped to
    * Scoped Project ID: The project ID this role is being scoped to.
